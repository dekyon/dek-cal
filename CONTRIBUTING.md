Hello and welcome to the Dekyon Calendar project!

Feel absolutely free to send pull requests. Please keep them respectful, don't load too much on the browser in GitHub Pages (our host).

The branches and the rules:

Branch|Rules
:--|:--
Master|Don't push or try to merge/pull request to master. Team members will push when the bugs are clear.
Indev|Any development changes should be pushed here. **USE THIS BRANCH.**
Beta/*Prerelease* |This is for fixing bugs and adding to betas. Beta/Beta should be pushed to Beta/Prerelease when it's needed.
Beta/*Beta* |Some indev versions can be pushed here. This should always be updated to match Master when a release is made.

## Releases
When I'm releasing, I'll push to master, then make the release. The release will contain a changelog based on the commit from indev (or beta/prerelease) to master.
